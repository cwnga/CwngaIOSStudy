 https://leetcode.com/problems/largest-number/
 Given a list of non negative integers, arrange them such that they form the largest number.

 For example, given [3, 30, 34, 5, 9], the largest formed number is 9534330.

 Note: The result may be very large, so you need to return a string instead of an integer.
